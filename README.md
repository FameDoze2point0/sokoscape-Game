In this Repository, you can find 3 stages of a C project that I had to create during my 2nd year of Bachelor Degree.
The purpose of this small project was to create a video game using the SDL library in C.
First step: 
In this step, we don't have much functionality, as we tried to install the SDL library on Ubuntu (this is the most annoying part of the project).
Then, when we succeed to install it, we had to make a map of tiles which correspond to our textures (that our teacher gave us)

You can see an example of the map below:
